Note: 
- ECE492 students should uncomment "#define ECE492" line
- use QUANTUM=10ms for these test cases

small_testcases.c
=================
Perform small virtual heap allocations, and allow to incrementally test: 
- vcreate 
- vmalloc
- vfree
- page fault handler: lazy allocation and segmentation fault
- allocations requiring multiple pages of PT
- concurrent processes

Outputs:
- ECE492 students: small_testcases_ece492.out
- ECE592 students: small_testcases_ece592.out

large_testcases.c
=================
Perform large virtual heap allocations 
 
Outputs:
The test case outcome is embedded in the run. A "#define DEBUG" allows printing out some debug information.
